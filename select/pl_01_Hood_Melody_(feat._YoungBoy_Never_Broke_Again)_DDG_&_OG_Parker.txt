G-got it on smash
OG Parker
All of my young niggas losing
they life
Cuz they don't know
that its life
that is outside the trap
Niggas be telling us
if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block
they be moving that work
He got the weed,
the coke and the percs
Nigga got a Glock
he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me Ima put him
on a shirt
High off the weed,
I cant even see
They killin each other off shit
from the earth
I got a bicky, I keep it with me
I never been shot
but I know that it hurts
Niggas killed my brotha back
in 2014
Streets know,
but the 12 ruled a cold case
That was back in Pontiac
in my old place
Niggas never really make
it to an old age
I gotta bring my Beretta
when I wear my jewelry
Cuz I do not know
what they thinkin
Niggas be plotting on me
when I'm blinking
I be too paranoid bitch
I be tweaking
(I be too paranoid)
I gotta move a certain way
Cannot be cool,
don't feel a way
Not to be rude, but go away
All of my young niggas losing
they life
Cuz they don't know
that its life
that is outside the trap
Niggas be telling us
if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block
they be moving that work
He got the weed,
the coke and the percs
Nigga got a Glock
he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me Ima put him
on a shirt
I know they watching,
emotions,
come straight out the sack
Protecting myself
in the trenches
I dun came all this way
I grew strong from the pain
and it hurt
Come and roll
when they see me now
Know these niggas
just wanna see me down
Came in she was loving me bad
She got her a baby,
don't wanna be with me now
You ain't right
and I see it written all
in your eyes
Tell no lies
Got bitches wanna fuck
with me now
I ain't make it home
til the sun go down
In the matter of some seconds,
then you call my phone
And my past be the reason
I ain't never slowing down
Messed around
and put another body
in the ground
In the car I'm rolling
with seventy sumn rounds
From the rolly to the L,
let em check for the sounds
Ain't no chicken,
I been standing on business
Got it jumpin' out the kitchen
I'm steady smoking out the pound
Slimes with me,
got a 30 in the glizzy
I ain't know, I'm sippin',
but gonna need another pint
by tomorrow
Keep my fingers clean,
got pre-rolls, im a stoner
They stepped on Elijah
but they on the corner
All of my young niggas losing
they life
Cuz they don't know
that its life that is outside
the trap
Niggas be telling us
if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block
they be moving that work
He got the weed,
the coke and the percs
Nigga got a Glock
he don't wanna get murked
If a nigga try me
Ima put him on a shirt
Shorty was with me
and I got her lit
But I heard she be hoppin
from dick to a dick
But I'm not tripping,
I know how it get
I am not putting my trust
in no bitch
Cant leave the crib
without bringing my stick
Got too much money,
I'm rich then a bitch
They killed my brother
that shit got me sick
Soon as they free em,
I'm getting him hit
Nigga I made it out
People had faded out
They never came around
Fuck what they saying now
Watch who you hang around
Keep you a thang around
Ain't no more swanging now
Niggas just spraying now
I don't know shit I ain't do it
I just rap, I influence
They just wanna know
what I'm doing
Made it out the hood,
I'm coolin
All of my young niggas
losing they life
Cuz they don't know
that its life
that is outside the trap
Niggas be telling us
if we don't dribble the ball
Then maybe a nigga can rap
Niggas on the block
they be moving that work
He got the weed,
the coke and the percs
Nigga got a Glock
he don't wanna get murked
